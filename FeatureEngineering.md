### Mathematical Operations: Creating New Features

#### Single Column
Apply functions such as log, sqrt, pow, or other functions that take 1 input.

#### Two Columns
Apply product,ratio, or other transformations that take 2 or more inputs.

### Bucketing: Dealing with continuous feature

### NLP: dealing with text feature

## Feature selection (Yin-side)

### Selection before traning

### Selection while training - LASSO regularization

Python Data Science Toolbox

This is my personal open notebook for Data Science in Python. I will put all explanations and codes embedded in mark down files (ending with .md), click on the files to view the contents. These are simple examples for performing the tasks. Always consult documents, or google when using the functions if you have any doubt.
I learnt the those tools from many sources, welcome to browse and edit  this notebook.
There are many great sources to learn Data Science, and here are some advice to dive into this field quickly:

0. Get some basic foundation in statistics and python. See www.hackerrank.com.
1. Get to know the general idea and areas of knowledge about data science.
2. Practice as you go. Search Google or Bing about any questions. Stackoverflow and supporting documents are your best friend. During this process, do not lose sight of the big picture of data science.
3. Become a better data scientiest by doing more projects! (Don't try to memorize these tools, just do data science!)
